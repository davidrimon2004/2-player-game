# 2-player-game
# This is the project that me and my friend Lydia (@lydiawagdi) did for our programing 2 course.
# It includes concepts like designing with the ascii code and C++. In addition to bullets, jumping ,etc.
# P.S. The multiple bullets and jumping has some bugs in it so either try to find a solution or feel free to check the my other code or Lydia's in our account.
